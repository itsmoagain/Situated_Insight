# Network Design 
This network isn’t a platform or protocol — it’s a modular, federated architecture for collaboration. DAOs self-organize, contributors define value, and data becomes a shared asset without losing local control. 

Each DAO is grounded in its own context: its people, crops, ecology, and governance practices. But through shared tooling and common principles, they remain interoperable — capable of learning from one another, contributing to joint funding rounds, and coordinating without losing autonomy.

Coordination-enabling AI helps DAOs bridge different priorities and knowledge systems. Agents can summarize deliberation, highlight climate risk clusters, or even suggest peer matches between co-ops with complementary needs.

Network design is the logic that makes this possible. It’s how participation is structured, how value flows back to contributors, and how new DAOs grow without central control.

This section introduces how the system works across three dimensions:

## Who Participates
Data contributors are the foundation of the regenerative data mosaic. They are the ones doing the work — planting, composting, grazing, protecting, monitoring — and voluntarily sharing those practices as structured logs. They include individual land stewards, cooperative networks, community organizations, Indigenous governance structures, and other locally-rooted actors. Contributors are not just “data sources”; they are decision-makers, validators, and co-governors of the infrastructure itself.

In this system, contribution is not a transaction — it is an act of participation, tied to local autonomy, real-world feedback, and evolving forms of shared governance.

### Roles and Rights
A contributor may be:

- An individual (e.g., a farmer, reforester, or seed collector)

- A cooperative or producer group managing shared infrastructure

- A validator, coordinating peer review or supporting data quality

- A knowledge holder or system maintainer (e.g., managing a weather sensor or shared node)

Regardless of role or form, contributors maintain core rights:

- To own their data

- To opt in or out of enrichment or sharing

- To receive feedback on submitted practices

- To participate in governance decisions that affect value flows and metrics

These rights are embedded in both technical design (e.g., consent metadata, local-first storage) and social agreements (e.g., cooperative protocols, DAO charters).

## Modes of Contribution
Contribution isn’t one-size-fits-all. The system supports multiple participation pathways:

          <li><strong>Direct Logging:</strong> via phone, SMS, or digital forms</li>
          <li><strong>Proxy Logging:</strong> by co-op or validator on contributor’s behalf</li>
          <li><strong>Sensor-Enhanced Logging:</strong> automated entries from local tools</li>
          <li><strong>Knowledge Layering:</strong> local context, notes, missing variables</li>
          <li><strong>Validation & Review:</strong> endorsements or review by DAO/peers</li>
        </ul>
        Contributors choose based on trust, time, bandwidth, and literacy.

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Climate Oracle Layer:</strong> adds overlays (SPI, NDVI)</li>
          <li><strong>AI Agent Layer:</strong> interprets and tags events (e.g., “adaptive grazing”)</li>
          <li><strong>Visualization Engine:</strong> generates scorecards, clusters</li>
          <li><strong>Credential Layer:</strong> bundles into Hypercerts or badges (opt-in)</li>
        </ol>
        Contributors receive insight first — others see it only if shared.

          <li><strong>Temporal Access:</strong> one-time or revocable later?</li>

        All settings persist across dashboards, reports, and credentials.

        </ul>
            </ul>
        Contributors are ** reflected back insight **, not just extractively mined.
