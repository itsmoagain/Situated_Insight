# Network Design

This network isn’t a platform or protocol — it’s a modular, federated architecture for collaboration. DAOs self-organize, contributors define value, and data becomes a shared asset without losing local control.

Each DAO is grounded in its own context: its people, crops, ecology, and governance practices. But through shared tooling and common principles, they remain interoperable — capable of learning from one another, contributing to joint funding rounds, and coordinating without losing autonomy.

Coordination-enabling AI helps DAOs bridge different priorities and knowledge systems. Agents can summarize deliberation, highlight climate risk clusters, or even suggest peer matches between co-ops with complementary needs.

Network design is the logic that makes this possible. It’s how participation is structured, how value flows back to contributors, and how new DAOs grow without central control.

## Who Participates

Data contributors are the foundation of the regenerative data mosaic. They are the ones doing the work — planting, composting, grazing, protecting, monitoring — and voluntarily sharing those practices as structured logs. They include:

- Individual land stewards  
- Cooperative networks  
- Community organizations  
- Indigenous governance structures  
- Other locally-rooted actors  

Contributors are not just “data sources”; they are decision-makers, validators, and co-governors of the infrastructure itself.

In this system, contribution is not a transaction — it is an act of participation, tied to local autonomy, real-world feedback, and evolving shared governance.

---

## Modes of Contribution

Contribution isn’t one-size-fits-all. The system supports multiple participation pathways:

- **Direct Logging**: Stewards log practices via phone, SMS, or paper-to-digital interfaces  
- **Proxy Logging**: Co-op coordinators or validators enter logs on behalf of members  
- **Sensor-Enhanced Logging**: GPS-tagged, time-stamped events from local tools  
- **Knowledge Layering**: Annotate logs with local observations or missing variables  
- **Validation and Review**: Peers or DAOs review or comment for credibility  

Contributors choose their mode of engagement based on context, trust, literacy, and time availability.

## From Practice to Insight: Enrichment Pipeline

When a contributor logs a practice, it flows through a multi-step enrichment pipeline — but only with consent at every step.

| **Pipeline Stage**           | **Function**                                                              | **Contributor Control / Consent Flags**                                   |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Climate Oracle Layer**  | Adds overlays like SPI, NDVI, rainfall anomalies                          | `enrichment_flag`: Should this log receive oracle data?                   |
| **2. AI Agent Layer**        | Tags and interprets enriched logs (e.g., "compost during drought")        | `ai_enrichment_opt_out`: Opt out of AI tagging or logic layers            |
| **3. Visualization Engine**  | Generates visuals (scorecards, clusters, time-series comparisons)         | Private by default; can be shared with DAO or public if permitted         |
| **4. Credential Layer**      | Optionally bundles logs into Hypercerts, DAO badges, or public outputs    | `DAO_visibility`, `public_access`, `temporal_access`: governs exposure    |

**Default Rule**: The contributor is always the first recipient of insights. No sharing occurs unless they explicitly permit it.

## Supporting Contributors

To make participation rewarding and non-extractive, the system includes:

- **Dashboards** showing timelines, anomalies, and practice summaries  
- **Real-time insights** based on enriched logs  
- **Funding eligibility flags** (e.g., “this log matches DAO reward criteria”)  
- **Peer recognition tools** like seasonal badges or voting  
- **Agent prompts** that surface patterns, questions, or trends over time  

Contributors receive a personalized, context-aware mirror of their land practices — not just a data receipt.

---

## Governance and Consent

Participation also means shaping how decisions are made, value is distributed, and systems evolve.

Governance is modular, bioregional, and consent-based — not imposed from above. Contributors co-create the logic, metrics, and flows that define what counts and what’s rewarded.

---

### Local-First, Federated by Design

Governance happens through autonomous but interoperable “nodes,” such as:

- Farmer cooperatives  
- Indigenous networks  
- Thematic clusters (e.g., agroforestry)  
- Multi-stakeholder alliances (e.g., researchers + stewards)  

Each node defines its own:
- Validation logic  
- Credentialing standards  
- Decision structures (e.g., voting, consensus, rotating roles)

---

### Participatory Mechanics

Governance roles are accessible — not just for “core teams.”

- **Log Validators**: Review and endorse logs  
- **Proposal Makers**: Suggest metrics, incentives, or visualizations  
- **Delegates**: Carry consensus between subgroups  
- **Rotators**: Seasonal or dynamic leadership  

DAOs may use frameworks like Coordinape, DAOhaus, or DisCO — adapting them as feedback comes in.

---

### AI Agents in Governance

AI agents don’t make decisions — they assist humans in navigating complexity.

Agents may:
- Surface proposals or pending validations  
- Detect under-validated data (e.g., “15% unverified”)  
- Suggest peer matches or enrichment use cases  
- Summarize log clusters into DAO-usable formats  

They extend awareness, reduce coordination burden, and keep things flowing — without overriding human input.

---

### Consent-Based Governance and Voting

Consent is embedded at every level:

- Contributors opt into governance tiers  
- Logs opt into validator review  
- DAO metrics and dashboards exclude data unless permission is granted  

Some DAOs offer tiered participation: light contributors may just log and receive feedback, while core members vote and co-govern.

---

### Meta-Governance and Emergence

Over time, DAOs may coordinate across the network — through:

- Shared metric libraries  
- Federated decision-making  
- Cross-DAO agent training or tooling standards  

But these are not imposed. They evolve through use, reflection, and feedback — not mandates.
