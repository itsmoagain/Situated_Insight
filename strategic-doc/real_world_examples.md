# Real-World Examples

How enriched data flows generate value — for contributors, DAOs, funders, and partners.

These examples show how steward-submitted practice logs are enriched with climate data, interpreted by agents, and shared (or not) based on consent and DAO settings. They illustrate how the system supports diverse goals — from local insight to ESG visibility — without sacrificing autonomy.

## Oaxaca Drylands: Composting in a Heatwave

**Context:**  
A maize farmer logs compost application during early planting season. Oracles detect a +2.8°C temperature anomaly and reduced rainfall. An enrichment agent tags the log with `compost_during_heat` and layers feedback about moisture retention and microbial buffering.

The agent also generates a simple visualization comparing:
- NDVI trend lines pre- and post-application  
- Soil temperature delta across composted vs. non-composted plots in the DAO region  
- Peer practices logged during similar anomaly periods

**Key Takeaways:**
- Steward receives contextual insight without sharing data beyond the dashboard  
- Visualization strengthens local practice validation  
- No external interoperability required for the contributor to gain value

## Patagonia Wool Network: Grazing During Drought

**Context:**  
Ranchers track rotational grazing using a mobile form. Oracles confirm moderate drought (SPI = -1.7), while NDVI data shows vegetative recovery. Enrichment agents tag logs with `adaptive_grazing`, highlight drought resilience, and prepare the logs for DAO-wide funding and optional external use.

With opt-in, logs are bundled into a Hypercert and formatted for a Scope 3–aligned ESG report requested by a regenerative textile buyer.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Contributors gain internal recognition and receive feedback on vegetation response  
- DAO receives payment from the buyer and redistributes funds to contributors  
- Logs become ESG-grade without losing steward-level insight and choice

## West Africa: Agroforestry Data Pooling for Research

**Context:**  
A DAO of 14 community co-ops logs intercropping, mulching, and natural regeneration practices. A soil scientist proposes a collaboration, requesting access to logs with NDVI increases and detailed practice overlays.

The enrichment agent filters and prepares anonymized logs that meet agreed criteria. In exchange, the researcher provides open model results and interpretation tools.

**Key Takeaways:**
- DAO receives technical support and insight in exchange for high-quality data  
- Contributors gain localized soil potential maps and visual summaries  
- Researcher avoids extractive data harvesting and contributes to system-wide learning

## Semi-Arid Maize System: Edge Shrub Planting

**Context:**  
A farmer logs the planting of a nitrogen-fixing shrub on the edge of a maize field. Oracles overlay heat anomaly (+2.4°C) and low soil moisture. Enrichment agents identify the micro-practice as adaptive, tagging it with `edge_shading`, `climate_buffering`, and generating dashboard feedback.

The log is surfaced in a DAO discussion about microclimate strategies and, with consent, included in a thematic Hypercert on low-cost climate buffers.

**Key Takeaways:**
- A small, culturally rooted practice becomes legible and recognized  
- The steward receives feedback and optional visibility in DAO peer learning  
- The log contributes to a broader narrative of climate adaptation at the margins
