# Core Concepts & Philosophies
### Adaptation
The ongoing adjustments land stewards make in response to shifting environmental conditions. This can include changing planting schedules, adopting drought-tolerant crops, adjusting grazing rotations, or altering water management to stay resilient amid climate stressors.

### Participation is Verification
The principle that meaningful engagement by land stewards—such as logging practices, sharing context, or contributing knowledge—is itself a form of verification. This reframes trust and accountability around lived experience rather than external audits alone.

### Feed Farmers First
A design ethic that puts land stewards and primary contributors at the center of value flows. Before data is extracted for institutional or market use, the system should provide insights, recognition, or material benefit to those doing the work.

### Bioregional
Describes systems and governance structures based on ecological boundaries (e.g., watersheds, ecoregions) rather than political borders. Bioregional approaches honor place-based knowledge, decentralized authority, and stewardship that reflects local realities.

## Ecological Value
The measurable or observable benefit that a practice brings to an ecosystem—such as improved soil health, water retention, biodiversity, or climate resilience. This value may not always be monetized but is critical to long-term sustainability.

## Climate Context
The environmental conditions surrounding a given action. For example, applying mulch during a heatwave or planting cover crops in anticipation of heavy rainfall. Context helps assess the relevance and impact of a practice more accurately.

## Verification Should Benefit the Verified
A design principle that insists verification systems return value to contributors, rather than extract data solely for institutional or commercial gain. It emphasizes feedback, support, and dignity in data collection.

# Data Structures & Governance Layers
## Practice Log
A structured entry created by a contributor documenting a regenerative practice. It typically includes a timestamp, geolocation, description, optional media, and can be layered with climate or satellite data for verification and analysis.

## Consent Layer
The rules or settings that control how data is shared and with whom. This includes whether logs are public, private, shared selectively with funders or researchers, or retained locally. Consent flows are essential for data sovereignty and trust.

## Federated Network
A system of autonomous but interoperable entities (like DAOs, cooperatives, or regional hubs) that share core infrastructure, data protocols, or standards. Each node governs itself while contributing to a larger shared mosaic.

## DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
A self-governed group that coordinates decisions and resources through smart contracts, digital voting, or collective off-chain processes. In regenerative systems, DAOs often represent bioregions, cooperatives, or steward networks.

## Portable Credential
A digital, verifiable identity or record of contribution that a user can carry across platforms. For land stewards, this might reflect verified practices, climate response actions, or participation history.

## Reputation Layer
An optional system for tracking contributions, trust, or verification status over time. This can take the form of badges, attestations, or stored histories, and helps foster accountability and recognition without central surveillance.

# Climate & Ecological Data Terms
## Climate Oracle
A tool or API that pulls real-world environmental data (like rainfall, temperature anomalies, or satellite imagery) into a system to provide context for logs. Oracles help automate enrichment and improve the relevance of verification.

## Anomaly Detection
A technique for identifying when climate conditions deviate significantly from the norm—such as unusually high rainfall or unseasonal heatwaves. These anomalies help flag meaningful environmental context for land-based practices.

## NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
A satellite-derived indicator of vegetation health, commonly used to detect greening, land cover change, or the success of ecological restoration over time.

## SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index)
A drought indicator comparing current precipitation to historical averages over a set period. A low SPI signals dry conditions that can affect land-based practices.

## Tiered Enrichment Model
A climate oracle strategy where different layers of data are applied based on relevance and consent:

Tier 1: Universal (e.g. rainfall anomaly)

Tier 2: Bioregion-selected (e.g. frost risk)

Tier 3: Experimental or steward-defined

## Time-Bound Verification
A verification approach that considers when a practice occurred relative to climate events, enhancing its ecological significance. For example, composting before rainfall or fallowing during heat stress.

# Proposed Tools, Protocols, Partners & Infrastructure
## Hypercerts
An open standard for encoding and issuing attestations of impact. A Hypercert can represent a time-bound, location-specific contribution (like a season of practice logs) and is designed to be discoverable, fundable, and verifiable across platforms.
hypercerts.org

## Gitcoin
A funding platform for public goods that uses mechanisms like quadratic funding. Projects with broad community support can receive matching funds. Often used to support open-source, climate, or regenerative initiatives.

## KoboToolbox / Tella
Field data collection tools that work offline and allow for structured input. Ideal for use in rural or low-connectivity environments where contributors log practices or observations on mobile devices.

## IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
A decentralized file storage protocol that allows data to be stored across a distributed network rather than in a central server. Ensures durability, contributor control, and censorship resistance.

## Holochain
A peer-to-peer development framework that allows users to own and manage their own data locally. Supports truly local-first apps where contributors can validate and share logs from their own device or node.

## Soulbound Token (SBT)
A non-transferable digital credential representing identity or contribution. In this system, it might encode a steward’s verification status, climate badges, or co-op membership.

## Proof of Impact NFT
A blockchain-based certificate that encodes a verified ecological action. This can serve as a badge, funding trigger, or composable data object across Web3 networks.

## Potential Collaborators & Ecosystem Partners
Disco.xyz
A decentralized identity platform offering “data backpacks” — portable, user-owned profiles that carry credentials, impact records, and access rights across platforms.

## Celo Public Goods
Part of the Celo blockchain ecosystem, which supports regenerative economies through mobile-first payments, stablecoins, and public goods funding.

## Silva / Carbon Direct
Organizations providing climate MRV support, especially for land-based or agroforestry projects. Silva specializes in participatory, community-aligned approaches to verification.

## Regen Network
A blockchain infrastructure and marketplace focused on ecological credits, land-use monitoring, and transparent regenerative finance.

## GainForest
A conservation platform using satellite imagery, AI, and community logging to verify and reward forest stewardship. They explore dynamic baselines and co-created data.

## Ma Earth / Bloom Network / AgroforestDAO
Initiatives supporting bioregional regeneration, Indigenous knowledge, and co-governed ecological networks. May serve as stewards, pilot partners, or DAO nodes.

## Common Approach
An organization developing flexible, shared standards for impact measurement. Aligns well with DAO-based data collection and community-led reporting.

## Prosperity Passport
A conceptual or emerging tool that links verified contributions to access — allowing stewards to unlock funding, decision-making roles, or public recognition based on their data history.
