# Building regenerative data mosaics for place-based insight [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.16054509.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16054509)


This repository hosts the documentation and design logic behind the Situated Insight Project —  
a system for federated, consent-based climate verification rooted in local agricultural practice.

This is a conceptual framework in development. Feedback and collaboration are welcome.

If you're working on related systems — like climate MRV, regenerative finance, co-op coordination, or steward-first data tools — I’d love your thoughts.  
Are the design choices here legible? What feels promising, missing, or worth pushing further?

Feel free to [contribute to the dicussion](https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/issues) or reach out directly.
